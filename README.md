# Description
I solved k knights problem with genetic algorithm. k is constant (in code it initialized 8 you can change it), mutation rate is 0.01(you can change it), population size is 200(you can change it) and mutation epoch is a random number between 5 and 10(you I solved k knights problem with genetic algorithm. k is constant (in code it initialized 8 you can change it), mutation rate is 0.01(you can change it) and population size is 200(you can change it).
